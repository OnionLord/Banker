Banker's Algorithm

Developers: Byron A. Craig & Ryan Robertson
Institution: James Madison University, 2013

Description:
------------

To run these files you need to use 'gcc' to compile and execute. These files altogether are very large and may
be hard to follow, but I included MANY comments to hopefully keep you from being confused. These programming 
files use InterProcess Communication and the files *banker.c* and *client.c* MUST BE RUN in two separate command
line windows.

I would not recommend running them in TABS because it will be hard to keep track of what is going on as it runs
very fast. Other than that, have fun testing these files!

*ALSO, THIS PROGRAM IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND THERE ARE STILL SMALL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE SORTED OUT*

Issues:
-------

- Math seems to be calculating more than it should, making the output values too big.
- Print output formatting may at times be buggy.
